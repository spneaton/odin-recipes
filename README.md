Odin Recipes - Steven Neaton

The point of this project is to learn HTML and CSS. I am at the beginning of learning development and design and currently working through online curriculum like the Odin Project and freeCodeCamp. 

These are recipes that I have learned from other people. The recipes are in no way serious, I'm not much of a cook. They are more memories to me than recipes. Each associated to a person or time of my life. With that in mind it might be something that I update as I learn more. The idea of capturing memories through food is edifying to me. 

My goal is to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I feel as if I have a good understanding of HTML and how CSS syntax is formed. It's the actual executing of CSS that I am working through. I hope to grow in my knowledge of how to position elements and layout an application through this project.
