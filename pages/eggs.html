            <h1>Real Scrambled Eggs</h1>
            <p id="introduction1-eggs">It was at the beginning of COVID where I watched Gordon Ramsay on YouTube tell me that I have been making scrambled eggs the wrong way. What I had been making was really just a chopped up omelette. Ramsay went on to make this soft scramble and I just had to try it. I haven't and won't got back. Try it out. If you think they don't look done, it's okay that's how they are suppose to look, they are done and they are delicious. This is just a positive take-away from the COVID era in my life.</p>
