            <h1>Ma's Cinnamon Toast </h1>
            <p id="introduction1-eggs">This one is funny because I think there are lot of us with a shared experience over this "recipe". It's the every mom cinnamon toast. Every now and then I'd come downstairs ready for school and for breakfast ma made our favorite simple meal, cinnamon toast! I still make it every now and then whenI want something quick and sweet. If you didn't grow up with this that's okay I'm sure you have a friend who could totally vouche for this. Thanks Mom's. This was awesome.</p>
